- Volume Conversion: Convert liters to gallons and gallons to liters.
- Mass Conversion: Convert kilograms to pounds and pounds to kilograms.

Allow users to select the number of decimal places for results.
Refactor JavaScript for better modularity.
Consider using a build process for Tailwind CSS instead of the CDN for production.
